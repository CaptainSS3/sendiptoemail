Hello and welcome to "Sendiptoemail"

This python script will allow you to regularly send the ip of your current machine to your email address.

To start, you need to create the account you will send emails from, I highly recommend that you create a new gmail.

Then go to account settings -> privacy -> let secure apps access , and turn it on (see screenshots).

run "setup.py" and input all the needed information.

when you are done, run "run.py".





* Libraries used: smtplib, ssl, requests, datetime, os, time
